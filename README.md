## Description
Beer Catalog is a web application built with **React** that allows users to explore and discover a variety of beers.

- **Search Functionality:** Search for beers by name, with real-time filtering of the displayed beers.
- **Loading Indicator:** A loading spinner/message is shown while fetching data from the API.
- **Pagination:** Beers are displayed across multiple pages (e.g., 5 beers per page), with next/previous page navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for a smooth user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used
- **React:** Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
